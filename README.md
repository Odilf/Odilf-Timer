## Contributing

If you found a typo or a easy issue to fix, feel free to raise a new issue. I will fix it if it's reasonable or I will close it if it's not. 

If anyone wants to implement a new feature or to make changes in the code themselves, I will *gladly* review and merge pull requests. Just don't expect me to make the development process easier (I have no clue what I would be suppossed to do). 

## Credits

Timer inspired mainly by [csTimer](https://csTimer.net) and partialy by [the cubing.js timer](https://timer.cubing.net/).
